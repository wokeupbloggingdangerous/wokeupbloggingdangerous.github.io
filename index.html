            <h1>Predicting the 2019 AL Central Winner Using Bill James’ Pythagorean Theorem</h1>
            <img src="" class="" alt="">
            <p>As of August 12, 2019, two teams are tied on top of the AL Central. The Indians, once 11.5 games behind the Twins on June 2, were able to claw their way back in just over two months. In fact, the Indians have the best record in the majors
                since falling behind 11.5 games back of the Twins. They have won 43 of their last 60 games. Over their last 30 games, the Twins have faltered, winning half. Tied with 44 games to go, which team has the best chance of winning division?</p>
            <p>Using the Pythagorean Theorem from Bill James, we can use the Twins’ and the Indians’ runs scored and runs against to predict the number of wins and losses for the rest of the seasons. The Twins have scored 675 runs and given up 548 runs this
                season. The Indians have scored 548 runs and given up 462 runs this season. The Twins have scored the third most runs in the league this year behind the Red Sox and the Yankees. The Twins lead the majors with 228 home runs and are on pace
                to set a record for most team home runs in a season. They are on pace to hit 318 home runs, 51 more than the record set last year by the New York Yankees. The Indians, with one of the best pitching staffs in major league baseball even
                after the trade of Trevor Bauer, are third in runs given up this season.</p>
            <p>A team’s scoring ratio is determined by dividing the number of runs scored by the number of runs against. Using the following Pythagorean formula, we can determine the expected winning percentage of a team: 〖Scoring Ratio 〗^1.9/(〖Scoring Ratio〗^1.9+
                1)=Projected winning % The Twins have a projected wining of percentage of 59.8%, while the Indians have a projected winning percentage of 58.0%.</p>
            <p>If you extrapolate the projected winning percentage across the next 44 games remaining in the regular season, both teams would be projected to win 26 games. Based on the prediction data, the AL Central would end in a tie and a one-game tiebreaker
                would be played for the division championship. Home field advantage would be given to the team with the better head-to-head winning percentage during the regular season. The Indians currently hold a slight advantage for home field advantage
                with 7 wins in 13 games. With three games to be played at Progressive Field and Target Field, respectively, the race is neck and neck the rest of the way.</p>
            <p>At this point in the season using the Bill James’ Pythagorean Theorem, there is no way to predict a clear winner in the AL Central.
